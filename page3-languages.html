    <p>The last section of my hobbies list is about languages. As I've mentioned before, I learned English in school, but there are other languages that I've studied at some extent. This are some:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>FRENCH</li>
            <p>I studied French for three years at an academy in El Salvador. I cannot say I completely understand the language nor speak it fluently. However, I do know some things, and still remember others. I was actually impressed to know that Canadian French and French French is very different. I once saw a video that proves it. Here it is:</p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdSSvXdG0p0">I Speak French Canadian For 24 Hours</a>
        </ul>
    
    <p>I would also like to learn other languages. Since these two are very similar to spanish in some way, I feel it won't be so difficult for me to learn. These are Italian and Portuguese.</p>
    <p>Here are some song I like in French, Italian, and Portuguese:</p>
