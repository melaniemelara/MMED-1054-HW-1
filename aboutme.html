    <h2>A Bit About Myself</h2>
    <p>My name is Melanie, I am 19 years old, and I am from El Salvador.</p>
    <img src="img/flagofelsalvador.jpg" width="550" height="391">
    <p> My native language is Spanish. I very first learned English and continued practicing it as I grew up, and engaged in different activities that helped me use and improve it a lot.</p>
 
    <h2>Some Hobbies I Have!</h2>
    <p>During my whole life my parents always wanted me to learn something new. So, I engaged in different activities that ended up becoming something I like to do in my spare time. These are some of them:</p>
    <ol>
        <h3>SPORTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>BALLET</li>
            <li>SWIMMING</li>
            <li>GYMNASTICS</li>
            <li>TAEKWONDO</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>MUSIC</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>PIANO</li>
            <LI>SINGING</LI>
        </uL>
        <h3>LANGUAGES</h3>

    <p>I am glad I've experienced so many good stuff in my early years, then as a teenager, and I hope I add up some new and great stuff to my list as a young adult! :)</p>
